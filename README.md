# Hola!

Vladimir here! Mathematician and physicist by training, data engineer/scientist by vocation; fluent in **Spanish**, and currently residing in Barcelona.

Also interested in quantitative finance (previous work experience in quantitative risk management), and web3 technologies (specifically smart contract development, and cybersecurity via ZK proofs)
