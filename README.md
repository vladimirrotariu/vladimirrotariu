# Hola!

Vladimir here! Mathematician and physicist by training, currently working as an AI engineer in the smart cities area.

Currently, my tasks revolve around designing predictive models for IoT data using **PyTorch/scikit-learn/statstmodels**, and integrating them in a REST API created with **FastAPI**. I am also occasionally in charge of data engineering tasks, such as writing highly efficient web crawlers using internal tools. 

I am fluent in **Spanish**, and currently residing in Sevilla, Spain.

## Publications 
* [Bohmian insights into mathematical scattering theory](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=nl&user=PZCJoksAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=PZCJoksAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC)

## Focus personal projects
* a series of microservices which lead to an AI-driven social media app, see for example the BLIP-large FastAPI appolication that is in charge of captioning user-uploaded images.
* a (now in a sketch stage) [Python package](https://github.com/vladimirrotariu/parallel-monte-carlo-simulations) that automates the creation of Apache Beam pipelines, in order to efficiently orchestrate in-parallel Monte Carlo simulations.
