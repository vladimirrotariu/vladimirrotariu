# Hola!

Vladimir here! Mathematician and physicist by training, currently working as an AI engineer in the smart cities area; fluent in **Spanish**, and currently residing in Sevilla, Spain.

Also interested in quantitative finance (previous work experience in quantitative risk management)!

* Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn for a chat: [Vladimir Rotariu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-rotariu-87081622b/).

## Publications 
* [Bohmian insights into mathematical scattering theory](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=nl&user=PZCJoksAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=PZCJoksAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC)

## Focus personal projects
* a (now in a sketch stage) [Python package](https://github.com/vladimirrotariu/parallel-monte-carlo-simulations) that automates the creation of Apache Beam pipelines, in order to efficiently orchestrate in-parallel Monte Carlo simulations.
